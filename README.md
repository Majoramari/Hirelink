# HireLink (Backend)

## Disclaimer (Graduation Project / Demo)

This repository is a **graduation project** and is intended primarily for learning and demonstration.

Some technologies and production-grade concerns were intentionally kept out of scope to keep the project deliverable
(for example: adopting **TypeScript** everywhere, switching the object-relational mapper (ORM) to **Drizzle**, adding a
full OpenAPI generator
pipeline, and similar tooling).

Treat this backend as an **educational/demo implementation** that demonstrates real-world patterns (auth, role-based
access control (RBAC),
Prisma/Postgres, validation, testing), but is not intended to be a ready-to-use production template.
